                    <p>New Era University College (NEUC) was established in 1997 following the closure of Nanyang
                        University in Singapore in 1980. It was the outcome of many years of efforts in addition to
                        unwavering support from the Malaysian Chinese community.</p>

                    <img src="img/newera2-logo.jpg" alt="New Era University College">
                    <p>On 30 December 2016 New Era was upgraded to University College status by the Ministry of Higher
                        Education. This upgrading allows New Era University College to confer its own degrees and
                        post-graduate degrees. Three faculties were thereupon formed out of existing departments and
                        entrusted to develop and introduce new degree courses. At the same time diploma courses
                        continued to be offered. These diploma courses while preparing graduates for a working career
                        also serve as a pathway to degree courses in New Era and in partner overseas universities.</p>
